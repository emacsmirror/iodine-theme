#### Using the theme

Copy the `iodine-theme.el` file to a directory where emacs will look for themes files. You can also define custom theme paths by adding this line to your `.emacs` file.

```elisp
(add-to-list 'custom-theme-load-path "/path/to/theme-file.el")
```
After making sure that emacs can find the theme file, the theme can be loaded with `M-x load-theme`
